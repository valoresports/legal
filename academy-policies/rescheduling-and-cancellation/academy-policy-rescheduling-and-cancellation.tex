\title{Academy Policy -- Rescheduling and Cancellation}

\textsc{Effective date: 26 February 2023}


\section{Introduction}
\subsection{What is a ``nominated contact person''?}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
A nominated contact person is somebody who usually deals with Valor on behalf of your team. In most cases this is the team's captain, and if the team has a manager then also that manager.

\item
If you would like to add somebody to your team's ``nominated contact person'' list please contact the Valor Admin Team\footnote{The ``Valor Admin Team'' means the co-founders of Valor, being \textit{Louk Issa, Sam Ward, and Nick Schlobohm}}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{How to contact the Valor Admin Team}
\subsubsection{Via the ``Booking Manager'' bot}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Please send a message through the ``Booking Manager'' bot and your query will be sent to a pool of server administrators that will respond to you as soon as possible.

\item
There will be a bot in the list of server users whose name is ``Booking Manager''. If you cannot find this bot, you can directly search for its username which is
``ModMail\#5460''.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Coach-initiated rescheduling or cancellation}
\subsection{More than 24~hours before session}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Your coach will work with the Valor Admin Team and other Valor coaches to find another coach to run your session at the original scheduled time. Your coach will wait five~(5) hours from initiation.

\item
\textbf{If a fill-in coach is found}, your coach will send a message explaining there will be a fill-in coach running your session and introducing that coach.

\item
\textbf{If no fill-in coach is found}, your coach will work with the Valor Admin Team to reschedule your session. Your coach will then send a message with the proposed session time. No session credit will be consumed by the original cancelled session.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{24~hours or less until session}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Your coach will work with the Valor Admin Team and other Valor coaches to find another coach to run your session at the original scheduled time. Your coach will wait fifteen~(15) minutes from initiation.

\item
\textbf{If a fill-in coach is found}, your coach will send a message explaining there will be a fill-in coach running your session and introducing that coach.

\item
\textbf{If no fill-in coach is found}, your coach will work with the Valor Admin Team to reschedule your session. Your coach will then send a message with the proposed session time. If no times are available, your session will need to be pushed back by a week. No session credit will be consumed by the original cancelled session.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Club-initiated rescheduling or cancellation}
\subsection{More than 24~hours before session}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Please have a \textbf{nominated contact person} get in touch with your team's coach to cancel or reschedule your session.

\item
Your coach will work with the Valor Admin Team to reschedule your session.

\item
Your coach will then send a message with the proposed session time.

\item
If no suitable times are available during the same week, your team's training program will need to be pushed back to finish a week later.

\item

\end{enumerate}


\section{Coach no-show}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
If your team's coach is not present at the scheduled session start time, please wait ten~(10) minutes after the scheduled start time as your coach may be experiencing technical difficulties.
