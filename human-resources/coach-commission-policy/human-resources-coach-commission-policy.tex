\title{Human Resources Document -- Coach Commission Policy}

\textsc{Effective date: 3 April 2023}

\section{Introduction}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Valor is customer-obsessed and know that deivering the best possible experiences to everyone increases the likelihood of them converting a free trial into being a paid customer, or staying as a paid customer.

	\item We wish to encourage our coaches to provide high-quality experiences, as well as bring more customers to Valor. We also believe in rewarding the good work that our coaches do.

	\item Accordingly, Valor offers a commission of the sales income generated by coaching services. Subject to this Policy, the commission system is set out in section \ref{sec_commissions}.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Commissions}
\label{sec_commissions}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item The commission rate payable to a coach, in relation to a given invoice, is:
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item for a new customer, converting from a free trial into a paid coaching services arrangement---ten per cent~(10\%) of the invoice amount (a \textbf{New Customer Commission}); and

		\item for a repeat customer, who has been a paid customer before---five per cent~(5\%) of the invoice amount relating to the coach's game (a \textbf{Repeat Customer Commission}),
	\end{enumerate}
		both a \textbf{Commission} for the purposes of this policy.

	\item Repeat Customer Commissions are scoped to the game.

	\itshape
	For example, if a customer re-signs with Valor and purchases fifty~(50) hours of Rocket League coaching, and thirty~(30) hours of Valorant coaching, then:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the Rocket League coach would receive five per cent~(5\%) of the amount on the invoice relating to Rocket League, and

		\item the Valorant coach would receive five per cent~(5\%) of the amount on the invoice relating to Valorant.
	\end{itemize}
	\normalshape
\end{enumerate}


\section{Considerations when calculating a Commission}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Any calculations related to a Commission apply after the application of all discounts afforded to the customer.

	\item Any calculations related to a Commission are exclusive of any amounts added to an invoice which relate to Valor's taxation liability (i.e. sales tax).

	\item A Commission becomes payable to the relevant coach after all of the following have occurred:

	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item the customer is issued with the relevant invoice; and

		\item the customer pays Valor the relevant invoice in full.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
